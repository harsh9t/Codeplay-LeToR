README for Patient Queries & Relevance Set
==========================================

The query and result set are distributed as part of the CLEFeHealth 2014 Task 3: "User-centred health information retrieval".

The official training query and result set for Task 3 consists of 5 queries and corresponding result set generated from manual relevance assessment (by medical professionals) on a shallow pool.

This README for the query and relevance set provides specific details on the training queries and result set. It also provides a sample pseudo-query.


*****************************************************
Query and Result Set Details Summary:
-------------------------------------
-Training Set contains [released 10 February]:
--5 queries in English (queries.clef2014ehealth.1-5.train.en.xml) and their translation in Czech, French and German (queries.clef2014ehealth.1-5.train.cs.xml, queries.clef2014ehealth.1-5.train.fr.xml, queries.clef2014ehealth.1-5.train.de.xml). 
--associated result set - binary () and graded version (clef2014t3.qrels.training.graded.txt)

-Query Test Set contains [released 1 April]:
--50 queries.

-Result Set for Test Queries [released 1 June]:
--generated by pooling runs submitted by task participants on 1st May, and having nursing professionals conduct manual relevance assessment on the pooled sets.

Query Set Details:
------------------

The queries have been manually generated by medical professionals from a manually extracted set of highlighted disorders identified in discharge summaries from Task 2. The topics are based on one of the main disorders of the discharge summary (that can either be listed in the "discharge diagnosis" field, or manually picked by medical professionals). 
A mapping between each query and the associated Task 2 matching discharge summary (from which the disorder was taken) is provided. Task participants are free to obtain access to the discharge summaries (http://clefehealth2014.dcu.ie/task-2/getting-started). It is not mandatory to obtain Task 2 dataset to participate in Task 3 but it can be used as an external resource if desired.

Queries are distributed for use in Task 3 in an extended TREC style format, where title, description and narrative are as in the classic format and the additional fields are as follows: 

discharge_summary: matching discharge summary
profile: details about the patient extracted, or inferred, from the discharge summary (which is required for determining the information which is being sought by the patient)

The following example outlines what a query looks like in the collection:

<query>
  <id>q01</id>
  <discharge_summary>file2.txt</discharge_summary>
  <title>thrombocytopenia treatment corticosteroids length
  </title>
  <desc>How long should the corticosteroids treatment to cure thrombocytopenia be?
  </desc>
  <narr>Documents should contain information about treatments of thrombocytopenia, and especially corticosteroids. It should describe the treatment, its duration and how the disease is cured using it.</narr>
  <profile>The patient is a professional, female. She has a short-term disease, or has been hospitalised after an accident (little to no knowledge of the disorder, short term treatment)</profile>
</query>


*****************************************************
Result Set Details:
-------------------
Relevance assessments for these 5 training queries were formed based on pooled sets generated using the Vector Space Model and Okapi BM25. Pooled sets were created by taking the top 30 ranked documents returned by the two retrieval models with duplicates removed.
Relevance assessment has been performed by medical professionals. Relevance is provided on a 2-point-scale: Non relevant (0); Relevant (1), and on a 4-point scale: Non relevant (0); On topic, but unreliable (1); Somewhat relevant (2); Highly relevant (3).  

The relevance assessment are provided in standard TREC qrel format.
