\begin{abstract}
In this note I try to list a possible number of algorithms and approaches put into practice in learning to rank based schemes. The survey is carried out form the work of author phophalia. This note is a part of an exercise carried out amongst the new introductions of habits for the year 2015. I hope this continues, and in a long term turns out to be an integral atomic part of the overall process of my research paradigm, \textit{i.e.} note making!

\section{Approaches in letor}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Pointwise approaches}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Regression
	The conventional and simple idea of ordinal regression is to map the ordinal scales into numeric values, and then solve the problem as a standard regression problem. In this approach, a document - query pair is considered in the training phase.
	\item McRank
	\item RankProp
	\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Pairwise approaches}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item AdaBoost
	\item RankBoost - 
	based on adaboost algorithm
	\item \textbf{Neural network based approaches} \label{nn}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item RankNet
	\item LambdaRank - based on RankNet
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{SVM based approaches}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item RankSVM \cite{15}
	\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Listwise approaches}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item ListNet (neural network based, see: \ref{nn}) - similar to RankNet
	\item LambdaMART - [10] combines MART and 	LambdaRank. MART is a boosted tree model in which output of the model is linear combination of the outputs of a set of regression trees. Since MART models derivatives and LambdaRank works by specifying the derivatives at any
	point during training.
	\item BoltzRank - It uses Boltzman distribution, [11] is to define a probability distribution over document 	permutations, and consider the expectation of the target performance measure under this distribution.
	\item BayesRank - It directly optimizes the Bayes Risk related to the ranking accuracy in terms of the IR evaluation measures. It uses Plackett-Luce Model as probability model of permutations. A multilayer perceptron \textit{\textbf{neural network}} is designed for learning BayesRank with NDCG related permutation loss. \ref{nn}
	\item FRank - FRank algorithm is proposed in [13] which is based on the concept of fidelity from physics.
	
	\item Rank Cosine - To find the similarity between estimated output and available ground truth result, Rank Cosine approach is proposed in [14].
