This repository is an effort towards summarizing most of the research work done in the re-ranking of the retrieved document in IR systems.
We use a variety of publicaly available datasets and compare a range of letor (learning to rank) algorithms and report their performance.
The main goal being to search for the best performing re-ranking algorithm in text-based IR systems.
